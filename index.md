## Introduction

This is a repository for teaching the basics of statistics for data science and machine learning. It is intended for use in an introductory data science class. 

This material can also be used by working professionals who want to learn the basics of data science, statistics and machine learning.

    * CONCEPT: look at distribution of p-values. q-value tells us the expected fraction of false positives in the significant tests below this threshold.

* Confidence intervals

   * How many standard deviations from the mean must you go to capture 95% of the scores

   * Computing 95% confidence intervals Mean +/- 1.96 * std/sqrt(no of samples)

         
         ci_alpha <- 0.05
         qnorm(ci_alpha / 2)
         qnorm(1 - (ci_alpha/2))
         
         boostrapped confidence intervals using confint(x, method = 'boot')
         
         d <- data.frame(w=rnorm(100),
                                x=rnorm(100),
                                y=sample(LETTERS[1:2], 100, replace=TRUE),
                                z=sample(LETTERS[3:4], 100, replace=TRUE) )
         do GLM on this new data frame
         fm2  <- glm(y ~ w + x + z, data=d, family=binomial)
         confint(object = fm2, method = 'boot')
         
         
   * meaning of confidence intervals

      * SUMMARY: if you repeat the experiment 100 times, 95 times the true value of the mean will fall within this interval.
            This does not mean than with 95% probability, the mean will fall in this interval
